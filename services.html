                    <p>Because we are a local, family-run business, we’re not in a hurry to complete as many projects in
                        as short a time as possible. We focus our time and attention on giving you exactly what you
                        want. Referrals are how we get most of our business, so we will do everything possible to make
                        sure that you are completely satisfied. Our best salesperson is a satisfied client.

                        Whatever your general contracting project, we’ll work with you with honesty and respect. Quality
                        and ethical contracting is much more than a sales pitch. You give us your ideas, and we’ll come
                        up with a plan that fits your budget. And we’ll never make you feel pressured.

                        We use top-of-the-line building supply products for all aspects of your renovation. This may
                        sometimes cost a little more upfront but our work will last a lot longer, saving you time and
                        money in the long run while increasing the value of your home.

                        To get started, we suggest an initial discussion where we discuss your project, goals, ideas,
                        timeline and budget objectives. Remodeling can be a complex process and budgets are affected by
                        many factors beyond the finishes or products you choose to utilize. If the size and scope of the
                        project exceeds your budget, you can either increase your budget or we’ll advise you on what can
                        be done within your means. Either way, we’ll work with you to find the right balance, while
                        providing you with useful and accurate information.

                        During the design stage, we’ll work closely with you to assess different layout and design
                        options. During the production phase, we order materials, schedule deliveries, organize our
                        labor resources, acquire building permits and organize everything necessary to ensure smooth
                        production of your remodel. This stage concludes with an on-site meeting to review the
                        production plan before work begins.

                        Then the fun begins! Since we’ve spent the necessary time and effort on design, planning and
                        pre-construction, AB Brothers Construction can then get to work providing you with the custom
                        home improvements you desire.

                        Be smart, shop around. We like informed clients. If you need educated, we’ll sit down with you
                        and make sure you understand every detail of your project.</p>
